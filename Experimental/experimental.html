        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Hi, welcome to my playground. I'm using GitHub.io as a free hosting service to practice my website building skills. Please note that this page is manually updated so I might miss stuff. For an always update-to-date directory, please navigate to <a href="https://github.com/yxu-k6mlx">my GitHub page</a> instead. </p>
        <p>Tread carefully, as this part of the site will contain all sorts of weird stuff. Nothing that will break your machine though.*</p>
        <h1>Here's the directory: </h1>
        <p> - <a href="./ba-stories/index.html">Blue Archive Stories</a>: Mandarin ONLY site. BA二创站点<a href="./ba-stories/index.html">入口</a>. </p>
        <p> - <a href="./journals/index.html">Journals</a>: an experimental posting board for text journals. </p>
        <p> - More on the way soon..</p>
        <p>* Not a legal statement. </p>

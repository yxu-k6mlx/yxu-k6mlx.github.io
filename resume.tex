\begin{rSection}{Summary}
I am Yanwen Xu, I have recently finished my master's degree at University of California, Santa Cruz in Computer Science and Engineering. Through my studies, I have gained over 4 years of hand-on experience working with various AI/ML models built on top of popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. I have built and deployed web based applications as both a middleware and API developer, and a back-end developer. In addition, I have achieved significant successes in my communications skills, thanks to my great friend and mentor, Gary Young, a local poet in Santa Cruz. Together, we have published over ten pieces on various literature journals, as well as a jointly authored book in poetry.

                            Hello, whoever is reading this. My name is Yanwen Xu. 
                            I am a Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, and I just graduated from <a href="https://ucsc.edu">UC Santa Cruz</a>. 
                            I made this website so I can have a publicly accessible platform showcasing my various projects, and an one-stop shop for my contact information. 
                            I am a FCC licensed amateur radio operation, currently holding a technician class license. My callsign is K6MLX. You can sometimes find me active 
                            on <a href="https://www.carlaradio.net/">CARLA</a>, mostly when I'm driving. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This website is still undergoing active development, and will be for at least a while.
                            You can take a look around this site by navigating through the navigation bar on top of the screen, or just scroll down to more postings like this one right on the homepage. 
                        </p>
